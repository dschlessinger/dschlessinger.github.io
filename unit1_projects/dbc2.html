			<h2 style="text-align:center">Directions:</h2>
			<p>Guacamole can be a tough nut to crack. Pleae don't attempt this if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>You don't have ripe avocados.</b> Unfortunately, this depends on the season and your location, so I'm not even going to try to instruct on this.</li>
				<li><b>You don't like cilantro.<b/> Sorry to all those who, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dining/14curious.html?_r=0">according to the New York Times</a>, taste soap instead of this delicious herb.</li>
				<li><b>You aren't willing to put in some elbow grease.</b> More on this when we get to mixing.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>With that in mind, follow these steps for heaven in a bowl.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Using a serrated knife, slide each avocado in half. Remove the seed and slice avocado into large mixing bowl.</li>
				<li>Chop onion into small pieces, then add to mixing bowl. <em>FYI:</em> chewing <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/26/onion-crying-cures_n_2760339.html">mint gum</a> counteracts your eyes' urge to cry. Try it!</li>
				<li>Chop tomato into small pieces, then add to mixing bowl.</li>
				<li>Slice jalapeño, then add to mixing bowl. Don't complain, just wait and be amazed. </li>
				<li>Slice lime in half, stab each half with a fork and juice into mixing bowl.</li>
				<li>Add garlic salt.</li>
				<li>To keep the cilantro as fresh as possible, we have saved it for the end. Chop up finely and add to taste, which <i>doesn't</i> mean to not add any.</li>
				<li>Use the bottom of a clean cup to mash and mix this beautiful concoction together.</li>
