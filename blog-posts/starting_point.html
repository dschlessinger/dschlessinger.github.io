      <h2>Problem that Responsive Design Fixes</h2>
      <p>Over the course of our daily lives we encounter many different screens.
      We use our laptops to read the news, our smart phones to stay current later in the day.
      When you change between these different resolutions, websites look entirely different.
      This difference in appearance comes from serveral areas. The goal of responsive design is to
      create a website that uses stylesheets stragetically, either with percentage widths
      or conditional formatting, to fit many different browsers and devices.

      <h2>How Responsive Design Works</h2>
      <p>In the past, web designers have laid out web pages in terms of fixed pixels.
      This works fine with most standard browsers, but smaller devices pose problems.
      According to an <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/beginners-guide-to-responsive-web-design/">August 2012 blog post on Treehouse</a>,
      one way to get around this issue is to convert the pixel widths of various elements into proportional widths.
      In this case, the original width in pixels is divided by
      the total number of pixels on a standard screen to determine the percentage of the screen
      that it occupies. Then, if a user resizes their screen or accesses the page
      on a smaller device, the code automatically recalculates the width of an element
      to fit the new resolution.</p>

        <h2>Takeaways of Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>Given the current paths of the web and the multitude of devices that are accessing the
            it, responsive design looks to be the future of web design. The ability to naturally 
            fit many different screens leads to a reduction in work required to have the
            most user friendly experience. We have covered only one approach to responsive design.
            There are many more ways to achieve this design philosophy using HTML and CSS creatively.

        <li>It wasn't so bad for us. We both had read all of the information thoroughly and most of the troubles we had were dealing with Stypi, which was being buggy for both of us. Other than that, we both agreed on how to 
        <li>They have greatly increased the amount of time people spend on the web, which means that designers have had to create every site with a mobile version. That has led both to challenges (some thing just can't work as well on a smartphone) as well as innovations (i.e., responsive design). Screens will continue to get smaller (e.g., smartwatches, Google Glass) and people will have to innovate yet again. I think that this is a great thing, actually - every time we have to overcome an obstacle, we have to confront the underlying faults of the system and make it better. I believe design will only continue to get better with these changes.</li>
        <li>One of my best friends is blind, and he uses the web, just very differently. I don't know if this is common, but he uses a highly sophisticated program that reads text aloud to him as he scrolls over a word with the house. Of course, accessibility is incredibly important. Now that I think about it, the ideal tree-like hierarchy of HTML would be very conducive to accessibility and understanding.</li>
        <li>I built responsive design into my blog from the start, since it just seemed to make much more sense than working with pixels. When I read about this concept, it really resonated with me, as did design thinking. Design thinking is something I try to use in everything I do, however - one of my stronger traits is empathy, so I strive to be mindful of how an action will affect other people. I am still a little confused about how exactly to debug errors using Chrome Dev Tools. The online tutorial didn't work well for me so I don't feel like absorbed this section incredibly well, but that may have been due to the advanced javascript stuff I'm not used to.</li>
