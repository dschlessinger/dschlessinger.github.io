				<p>Stereotype threat fascinates me. Of course, I don't like that it happens - and I'll define what "it" is in a second - but what it says about human psychology is pretty weird and interesting. <b>Stereotype threat</b> is defined by <a href="http://mrnas.pbworks.com/f/claude%20steele%20stereotype%20threat%201995.pdf">Steele and Aronson (1995)</a> as "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group."</p>

				<p>In laymen's terms, these two scientists conducted an experiment showing that black college students performed worse that white students on a standardized test when their race was emphasized. <b>But when their race was never mentioned, they performed the exact same.</b></p>

				<p>Think about that sentence. By the way, I should mention that poorer performance was also noted in replicated experiments but with participants being mentioned a positive stereotype. How could that be?</p>

				<p>Maybe it's not the internalization of the negative (or positive) stereotype, Steele and Aronson concluded. Maybe it's the fact that it takes so much mental effort <em>just trying to beat the pessimism or live up to the optimism that in the end</em>, test results suffered. It really does make sense when you think about it.</p>

				<p>I've encountered some variant of stereotype threat in the yoga studio, of all places - both as a student and as a teacher. But first, some background: I have this theory that maybe 90% of people who regularly come to yoga classes <em>secretly just want to be complimented by the teacher.</em> As a teacher, I really try to tow the careful line between a) challenging the students to push themselves beyond their limits, and b) not pushing too hard that they just give up.</p>

				<p>But of course, yoga is an intensely personal practice, and so it varies from student to student. And so I've actually stopped telling students that "they know they can do this" or something like that, because it puts too much pressure in their minds. As Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, one of the most influential yoga "gurus" of our time, said, "Practice and all is coming." Best to leave students to do what they can do without bogging them down with any expectations whatsoever.</p>
