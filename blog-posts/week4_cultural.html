				<p>I was downloading a package for Sublime Text 3 last week, when I read that some people are starting to call Sublime "abandonware." Concerned, I looked over <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime's website</a> and noticed what many others have begun to criticize: Sublime hasn't had any version updates since the release of its beta version 3 in December 2013. I started reading that its founder, Jon, had virtually disappeared and had "<a href="http://robmuh.com/language-editors/">long since abandoned regular updates." Of course, this would be problematic for any software - but it particularly affects us at DBC because Sublime is the text editor of choice here. Not to mention that Sublime Text 3 is an absolute joy to use, and it would be heartbreaking to hear that it's only downhill from here. Naturally, I wanted to come to the bottom of this. Here's what I found:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Sublime isn't abandoned:</b></li>
					<li><b>:</b> </li>
					<li><b>:</b> </li>

				</ol>

				 When I first took the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html/">Gregorc Thinking Style test</a> during the Prep Phase, I was in the middle of final exams and couldn't devote much time or brain power. As a result, I don't think my original score (tied for both abstract thinking styles) was absolutely correct. Today, I retook the exam and got a different result.</p>
				<p>I wasn't too surprised to learn that my thinking style is all but balanced between all styles. This isn't a common test result. Usually, people score highly in either one style or two styles sharing one quality (both abstract or both random, for example). But I prefer to learn various kinds of information differently. My whole life, I have been both a science and a humanities person. Next year, I'll start medical school, but I majored in the classics. One of my favorite parts of college was writing and editing my school's science/medicine section. I loved showing people how complex topics could be awesome.</p>
				<p>Now that I think about it, it really does make a lot of sense:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I imagine how a yoga pose should feel in order to reach it (<b>abstract random</b>).</li>
					<li>I first do math problems in my head (<b>abstract sequential</b>), but if they're really bugging me I write it all out, in order, on paper (<b>concrete sequential</b>).</li>
					<li>I feel and imagine literature (<b>abstract random</b>).</li>
					<li>When I code, I like to tinker and experiment until it works (<b>concrete random</b>).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some might see this kind of Gregorc result as a disadvantage. I see it as a challenge and an opportunity!</p>
