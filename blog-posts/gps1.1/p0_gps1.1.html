            <h2>Defining pair programming:</h2>
            <p>Pair programming is a method for developing code between two programmers. It provides colloboration between two people and helps make better design of the webpage. By doing this you allow both partners to interact and discuss what you like, don't like and what can improve. The way it usually works is we have two roles: a <b>navigator</b> and a <b>driver</b>. The navigator is in charge of coding. The driver is in charge of observing the navigator's process, helping out when necessary, and guiding with pseudocode the general progression of the project.</p>
