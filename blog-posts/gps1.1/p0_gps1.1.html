            <h2>Defining pair programming:</h2>
            <p>Pair programming is a method for developing code between two programmers. It provides colloboration between two people and helps make better design of the webpage. By doing this you allow both partners to interact and discuss what you like, don't like and what can improve. The way it usually works is we have two roles: a <b>navigator</b> and a <b>driver</b>. The navigator is in charge of coding. The driver is in charge of observing the navigator's process, helping out when necessary, and guiding with pseudocode the general progression of the project.</p>

            <p style="text-align:center"><i>Pairing is caring, folks.</i><p>
            <p>It makes sense to me that DBC puts a very high value on pair programming. The process inherently helps both partners learn about coding, by having to either break down code into something that the other can easily follow, or having to follow and interpret someone else's thought process. That's person might think completely differently from you. Of course, it requires good sportsmanship and develops great teamworking skills over time. I look forward to pair programming when I get to DBC.<p>
